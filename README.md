# Hospital-Management-System-on-PL-SQL
__This project was done when I took IS-620 course at UMBC.__

Implemented a hospital management system using PL/SQL with a broad spectrum of features that included the addition of multiple patient entries to the database, assigning a room to the patient, treatment, prescribing a drug among others. Checked valid patient admission, room assignments and various other features.
